If you browse any company careers page, you will encounter a bunch of software engineer titles with varying responsibilities and descriptions. But I got you covered! Here you’ll find the most popular roles in a software engineer’s career path, with overview of what it takes to do that job, and the approximate compensation info.

In addition, I dispel some secrets about these engineering ranks. Taken from my basket of personal experience and working with others being in them.

## Breaking Into Tech (Entry Level Software Engineer)
We all gotta start somewhere! And there’s no one way you’re supposed to break into the industry. One path is through college, getting an internship, and then a full-time offer. Another is transitioning from a similar role, like data engineering, into swe. In my case, it was hustling to get an opportunity to do software related work at any company with any role, and then working my way up. If you’re interested to learn more about how I got started [click here](https://www.lodely.com/blog/getting-a-job-at-facebook-after-being-rejected-from-all-colleges).

### 1. Software Engineer Intern
A Software Engineering Internship is a short program where you get a chance to delve into your team’s domain - build a project end to end, solve a problem, and ask a lot of questions.

In this position, you have maximum support from everyone in the team and company. So the most important thing is to be proactive and don’t hold back any need for help.

This is also a pivotal time to strike a good impression on co-workers and get a return offer. The chance to get an offer from an internship is way more likely than from interviewing.

**Average Compensation:** Typically $20/hr - $30/hr in the US.

**Main Responsibilities:** Building the project. Presenting it to steak holders. Proactive communication.

**Challenges:** Overcoming obstacles in the way of completing your project.

### 2. Junior Software Engineer (L3 IC)
This is your starting role as a full time engineer. In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to experience core software engineering workflows - build systems, write tests, dogfooding, debugging, oncall, and more.

At this point, You’ll have a share of your team’s responsibility on making impact. So your work will have to tie into the team strategy. Meanwhile, you also have support readily available from your tenured co-workers. They can help unblock any issues you might face.

Your performance is largely based on your productive output. So making sure you’re executing on initiatives and shipping code is critical. The more the better.

**Average Compensation:** Typically, between $50k - $200k in the US.

**Main Responsibilities:** Delivering projects. Handling rollouts. Proactive communication. High standard of code excellence. High code output.

**Challenges:** Keeping your team in the loop often, especially when last minute issues, delays come up. Having the ownership mentality to take responsibility and drive work to completion.

### 3. Software Engineer (L4 IC)
At this point you’ll have years of experience in the field with numerous shipped projects. You should feel really comfortable with the product development lifecycle. And serve as a key member that your team can rely on for various needs. Like work stream execution help or oncall or high pri task handling.

You should be an onboarded, efficient, and effective member of the team with substantial skin in the game to deliver on the team’s commitments.

Your performance is based on multiple factors - code output (productivity). Impact i.e was the project successfully completed and shipped, bonus points for moving metrics. Code quality.
